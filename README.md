# InfANT
###Changelog
Full changelog can be found [HERE](http://bitva-pod-moskvoy.ru/_kaspersky/changelog.txt).

It's **not a final version**, but the current functions are 100% finished (that's why it's called *Release*)

###Summary
**InfANT*** is an open-source antivirus project written in C#.
It was created by 2 Russian students in a few months.

It has **no** databases included, and at this point in can be used only as a basis for more complicated projects.

It was **not** tested on Linux and it probably will never be.

###Futurelog
 * Make an installer with autostart (it's currently portable only)
 * Add an ability to scan compressed files
 * Integrate it into right-click menu
 * Optimize scanning on high-end machines
 * Add real-time protection (detect new drives, detect opened binaries)
 * Seperate GUI and libs in 2 different packages
 * ?Add translations to other languages
 * ?Switch to MD5 and add some databases
 
###Detailed info
Later?
